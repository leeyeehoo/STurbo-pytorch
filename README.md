# SiamVGG

SiamVGG adopts SiamFC as the baseline approach. It applies a fully-convolutional Siamese network to allocate the target in the search region. SiamVGG uses modified VGG-16 network as the backbone. The network is trained offline on both ILSVRC VID dataset and Youtube-BB dataset end-to-end. The model SiamVGG gets significant improvements when compare to the original SiamFC.
