# SiamVGG

SiamVGG adopts SiamFC as the baseline approach. It applies a fully-convolutional Siamese network to allocate the target in the search region. SiamVGG uses modified VGG-16 network as the backbone. The network is trained offline on both ILSVRC VID dataset and Youtube-BB dataset end-to-end. The model SiamVGG gets significant improvements when compare to the original SiamFC.

## Getting Started

### Hardware Environment

⋅⋅⋅ Unordered sub-list. 

⋅⋅⋅ System: ubuntu 14.04 LTS

⋅⋅⋅ Memory: 15.6 GiB

⋅⋅⋅ Processor: Intel Core i7-7700K CPU @4.20GHz * 8

⋅⋅⋅ Graphics: GeForce GTX 1080 Ti/PCle/SSE2

⋅⋅⋅ OS type: 64-bit

### Prerequisites

1. First ordered list item
2. Another item
⋅⋅* Unordered sub-list. 
1. Actual numbers don't matter, just that it's a number
⋅⋅1. Ordered sub-list
4. And another item.

⋅⋅⋅You can have properly indented paragraphs within list items. Notice the blank line above, and the leading spaces (at least one, but we'll use three here to also align the raw Markdown).

⋅⋅⋅To have a line break without a paragraph, you will need to use two trailing spaces.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅Note that this line is separate, but within the same paragraph.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅(This is contrary to the typical GFM line break behaviour, where trailing spaces are not required.)

* Unordered list can use asterisks
- Or minuses
+ Or pluses
